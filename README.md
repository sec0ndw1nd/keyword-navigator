# Keyword Navigator

I used to add shortcuts for my favorite sites in my Chrome browser's search engine to make it easier to navigate between them.
But now, the Site Search's URL requires %s in query so it no longer works. That's why I made this extension.
All of your data are saved in your browser's extension local storage.
So, Feel free to use it!
